- The Login And Registration Differentiate From The App For Multiple Reasons. One Of The Reasons Being Security. The App
And vAIFAIO Panels Run Off Of Two Different Databases because Of The Framework Algorithms. The Different Databases Makes It
Easier For Users To Recover Their Accounts If Needed, Also Making It To Where The Databases Interact So Each Set Of Logins
And Registrations Are Encrypted And Backed Up Daily To One Big Database.
- Login And Registration Security : The Security For This Panel Is Attached To The Database Making It Easy For Users To
Signup, Login, And Not Worry About Their Information Being Exposed. The Security Also Makes It Difficult For The Panel To Be
Exploited.
